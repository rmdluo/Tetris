# Tetris

One of my friends from school needs this for a school project, so I made it. It is tetris with mostly correct rotation (which most people get wrong online). It is very basic and most closely resembles the NES version of Tetris. It has the hold box and next pieces preview as well. Version 1 is for people who don't want extra features like the hold box and the piece preview and version 2 is for the people who do want it.

### Prerequisites

The software you need is Python 3.x and Pygame.
You can get Python 3.x at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Through the command-line or terminal, you can use pip to install pygame.

```
pip3.x install pygame
```

### Installing

Download the files from this project, and run the tetris.py file which is in the version 1 folder. If the files get zipped, then unzip it.

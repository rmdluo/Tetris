# Tetris

One of my friends from school needs this for a school project, so I made it. It is tetris with mostly correct rotation (which most people get wrong online). It is very basic and most closely resembles the NES version of Tetris. 

### Prerequisites

The software you need is Python 3.x and Pygame.
You can get Python 3.x at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Through the command-line or terminal, you can use pip to install pygame.

```
pip3.x install pygame
```

### Installing

Download the files from this project, and run the tetris.py file which is in the version 1 folder. If the files get zipped, then unzip it.

## Built With

* [Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) - The Programming Language
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - Used to make the User Interface
